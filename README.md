# Advent of Code - TypeScript

(Mostly all) Advent of Code solutions in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

These solutions are not meant to serve as a guide for those learning TypeScript. This repo contains
various hacky tricks and nuances of JavaScript that should not be used in everyday code.

## Self-imposed Rules

- Under 100 lines
- Execution time of <=100ms; max 5s
- No third-party packages/libraries (apart from `yaml` to load the input)
  - *Currently in the process of conveting lodash*
- No global/prototype pollution

## Input Format

Input files are written in YAML. Why? Because I got tired looking at 25 different text files, and JSON
doesn't support multiline strings.
